# ZSH
The [Z shell][zsh] is a Unix shell that can be used as an interactive login shell and as a command interpreter for shell scripting

# Using this file

## Requirements
I've installed [Oh my zsh][ohmyzsh] in `/usr/share/oh-my-zsh` to feel better

## Put the configuration file
You can link your zsh config file by making a symbolic link to current file

```sh
ln -s ~/path/to/repo/dotfiles/zsh/zshrc ~/.zshrc
```
